      <h2 style={styles.heading}>üõ†Ô∏è Why I Built TorServ</h2>

      <p style={styles.paragraph}><strong>TorServ</strong> was built because I couldn‚Äôt believe it didn‚Äôt already exist.</p>

      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        I wanted to self-host a basic website ‚Äî anonymously, as a Tor hidden service ‚Äî and I assumed there would be a dead-simple tool for that. Something where you unzip, run, and instantly get a .onion address without configuring a web server, opening ports, or writing a torrc file.
      </p>

      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        There wasn‚Äôt. And for most people, setting up a Tor hidden service is technically daunting ‚Äî even for experienced sysadmins. For those without technical backgrounds, it‚Äôs close to impossible.
      </p>

      <h3 style={styles.subheading}>üó£Ô∏è A Tool for People Who Can‚Äôt Speak Freely</h3>

      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        <strong>TorServ isn‚Äôt just for tinkerers or developers ‚Äî it‚Äôs for anyone who needs to publish freely in high-risk environments.</strong>
      </p>

      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        That includes journalists, whistleblowers, and activists who face real punishment ‚Äî or worse ‚Äî simply for telling the truth. My vision is simple: <em>freedom of speech for everyone on earth</em>. It‚Äôs a fundamental human right.
      </p>

      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        TorServ was built to make anonymous publishing more accessible. No config. No clearnet. No servers to rent. You just unzip and run it locally ‚Äî and your Tor hidden service appears automatically.
      </p>

      <h3 style={styles.subheading}>üîç No Existing Solutions</h3>

      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        When I searched, I expected to find something like this. But there was nothing. Not even a minimal script. It felt like inventing the spoon ‚Äî obvious in hindsight, but strangely absent. So I wrote one.
      </p>

      <h3 style={styles.subheading}>üõ°Ô∏è Privacy by Default</h3>

      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        I don‚Äôt claim to be a security expert. But I tried to build TorServ with smart defaults that assume compromise, not safety. Some of the features I included:
      </p>

      <ul style={styles.list}>
        <li>Fingerprint and timing attack resistance</li>
        <li>Encrypted filenames in the HTML</li>
        <li>Response padding and header sanitization</li>
        <li>No JS, no tracking, no outbound traffic ‚Äî ever</li>
      </ul>

      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        These ideas aren‚Äôt perfect, but they‚Äôre a start. And I welcome all feedback, audits, and improvements from the privacy and security community.
      </p>

      <h3 style={styles.subheading}>üåç Open Source and Community-Led</h3>

      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        TorServ is open source under the MIT License. I hope others will contribute ‚Äî through code, translations, documentation, or simply ideas. It‚Äôs very much a work in progress, and I‚Äôm listening to the community to guide what comes next.
      </p>

      <p style={styles.paragraph}>

      <p style={styles.paragraph}>Thank you to everyone using Tor, building tools for the dark web, and defending digital privacy. This is my small contribution to that effort.</p>
